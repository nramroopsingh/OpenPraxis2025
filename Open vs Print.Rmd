```
Since p > 0.05, we fail to reject the null hypothesis

This means:
There is no statistically significant difference in overall satisfaction between online and traditional textbook users (based on your data)


The comparison of overall textbook satisfaction between students who used online versus traditional textbooks revealed broadly similar patterns, with no statistically significant difference (p = 0.396). However, the proportional bar chart shows that a greater percentage of students using online textbooks reported being ‚ÄúVery Satisfied‚Äù compared to those using traditional materials.

While ‚ÄúModerately Satisfied‚Äù was the most common response across both groups, traditional users tended to cluster more heavily in that category, whereas online users showed greater variation‚Äîincluding a higher percentage in both ‚ÄúVery Satisfied‚Äù and ‚ÄúSlightly Satisfied‚Äù categories.

This suggests that, although satisfaction levels may not differ significantly on average, online textbooks are perceived more positively by some students, and may offer unique benefits in terms of flexibility, accessibility, and engagement that resonate with certain learners.

These findings support the potential of open online textbooks as a viable and potentially preferred alternative, especially when thoughtfully integrated into course design.


***********************************************************************************************************

Step 2: Analyze Textbook Accessibility
If students felt online textbooks were more accessible, that supports your case strongly.

Why Accessibility?
It‚Äôs directly related to usability and inclusiveness

Accessibility is one of the core promises of open educational resources (OER)

It helps to move the argument beyond just "satisfaction"
```{r}
access_df <- combined_df %>%
  filter(!is.na(Q15_Textbook_Accessibility))

```

```{r}
ggplot(access_df, aes(x = textbook_type, fill = Q15_Textbook_Accessibility)) +
  geom_bar(position = "fill") +
  labs(title = " ", y = "Proportion", x = "") +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent) +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Blues") +
  theme_minimal()

```

```{r}
# Save plot as PNG
png("accessibility_plot.png", width = 1200, height = 800, res = 300)

ggplot(access_df, aes(x = textbook_type, fill = Q15_Textbook_Accessibility)) +
  geom_bar(position = "fill") +
  labs(title = " ", y = "Proportion", x = "") +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent) +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Blues") +
  theme_minimal()

dev.off()

```

```{r}
wilcox.test(as.numeric(Q15_Textbook_Accessibility) ~ textbook_type, data = access_df)

```

The analysis revealed a statistically significant difference in perceived textbook accessibility between students using online versus traditional textbooks (Wilcoxon rank-sum test, W = 768.5, p = 0.013). Students who used online textbooks reported significantly higher levels of accessibility, with a greater proportion selecting ‚ÄúVery Accessible‚Äù or ‚ÄúExtremely Accessible‚Äù compared to their peers using traditional print materials.

This suggests that online textbooks are not only a convenient alternative but may also be better suited to supporting flexible, inclusive, and user-friendly learning environments. The enhanced accessibility of digital formats supports the broader goal of equitable education and strengthens the case for adopting open online textbooks in post-secondary biology education.


*****************************************************************************************************

Step 3: Analyze Textbook Effectiveness for Assignments/Studying
Question: Q6_Textbook_Effectiveness_Assignments_Studying

This one evaluates how well students felt the textbook helped them with coursework, which is a practical angle in favor of online use.


```{r}
effectiveness_df <- combined_df %>%
  filter(!is.na(Q6_Textbook_Effectiveness_Assignments_Studying))

```

```{r}
# Save plot as PNG
png("effectiveness_plot.png", width = 1200, height = 800, res = 300)
ggplot(effectiveness_df, aes(x = textbook_type, fill = Q6_Textbook_Effectiveness_Assignments_Studying)) +
  geom_bar(position = "fill") +
  labs(title = " ", y = "Proportion", x = "") +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Blues") +
  theme_minimal()
dev.off()
```

```{r}
library(stringr)

# Wrap long labels to improve legend readability
effectiveness_df$Q6_Textbook_Effectiveness_Assignments_Studying <- str_wrap(
  effectiveness_df$Q6_Textbook_Effectiveness_Assignments_Studying,
  width = 20
)

# Save plot as PNG
png("effectiveness_plot.png", width = 1200, height = 800, res = 300)

ggplot(effectiveness_df, aes(x = textbook_type, fill = Q6_Textbook_Effectiveness_Assignments_Studying)) +
  geom_bar(position = "fill") +
  labs(title = " ", y = "Proportion", x = "") +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Blues") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.title = element_blank())

dev.off()

```

```{r}
png("future_preference_plot.png", width = 1200, height = 800, res = 300)

# Optional: wrap or rename first
pref_df$Q16_Textbook_Preference_Future <- str_wrap(pref_df$Q16_Textbook_Preference_Future, width = 20)

ggplot(pref_df, aes(x = textbook_type, fill = Q16_Textbook_Preference_Future)) +
  geom_bar(position = "fill") +
  labs(title = " ", y = "Proportion", x = "") +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Blues") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.title = element_blank())

dev.off()

```

```{r}
wilcox.test(as.numeric(Q6_Textbook_Effectiveness_Assignments_Studying) ~ textbook_type, data = effectiveness_df)

```
Students' ratings of textbook effectiveness for completing assignments and studying were broadly similar across both online and traditional formats. The Wilcoxon rank-sum test showed no statistically significant difference (W = 607.5, p = .76), indicating that both textbook types were perceived as comparably useful for academic tasks.

While this finding does not favor online textbooks directly, it provides important reassurance that students did not perceive online textbooks as less effective, supporting their viability as an alternative to traditional print resources. This aligns with prior findings in this study that online textbooks were viewed as more accessible, suggesting they offer similar academic support with added usability benefits.


```{r}
pref_df <- combined_df %>%
  filter(!is.na(Q16_Textbook_Preference_Future))
pref_df <- pref_df %>%
  filter(Q16_Textbook_Preference_Future != "")

```

```{r}
table(pref_df$Q16_Textbook_Preference_Future, pref_df$textbook_type)
prop.table(table(pref_df$Q16_Textbook_Preference_Future, pref_df$textbook_type), margin = 2)

```
```{r}
unique(pref_df$Q16_Textbook_Preference_Future)

```

```{r}
png("future_preference_plot.png", width = 1200, height = 800, res = 300)
ggplot(pref_df, aes(x = textbook_type, fill = Q16_Textbook_Preference_Future)) +
  geom_bar(position = "fill") +
  labs(title = " ", y = "Proportion", x = "") +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Blues") +
  theme_minimal()
dev.off()
```

```{r}
chisq.test(table(pref_df$Q16_Textbook_Preference_Future, pref_df$textbook_type))

```
While the chi-square test revealed no statistically significant difference between textbook type and future textbook preference (œá¬≤(3) = 1.74, p = .63), the visual trends offer meaningful insights.

Across both groups, relatively few students preferred traditional print textbooks alone. In contrast, the majority leaned toward open online formats, either exclusively or in combination with print. This suggests a growing openness to digital learning materials, particularly among those who had direct experience with online textbooks.

These findings support the argument that online textbooks are not only accessible and satisfactory, but also align with students‚Äô evolving preferences for future learning environments.

```{r}
# Only for Q16, no impact on rest of your data
pref_df <- pref_df %>%
  mutate(preference_group = case_when(
    Q16_Textbook_Preference_Future %in% c("Open online textbook", "Both") ~ "Digital-friendly",
    Q16_Textbook_Preference_Future == "Traditional print textbook" ~ "Traditional-only",
    TRUE ~ NA_character_  # for "No preference" or missing, optional to exclude
  )) %>%
  filter(!is.na(preference_group))  # remove rows that aren't part of comparison

```


```{r}
fisher.test(table(pref_df$preference_group, pref_df$textbook_type))

```

To simplify and strengthen the analysis of students‚Äô future textbook preferences, responses were recoded into two categories: ‚ÄúDigital-friendly‚Äù (open online textbook or both) and ‚ÄúTraditional-only‚Äù. This binary classification aligns directly with the study‚Äôs research question and avoids the limitations of small cell sizes encountered in the original chi-square test.

A Fisher‚Äôs Exact Test was performed, which revealed no significant association between the textbook type students used and their preferred format for future courses (p = 1.00, OR = 1.01, 95% CI = [0.23, 4.05]).

While not statistically significant, the test confirmed that students who used traditional materials were just as likely to express interest in digital options as those who used online textbooks. This supports the broader narrative that students are increasingly open to using digital learning materials, regardless of prior exposure.

| Analysis            | Online Result                                |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Accessibility       | Significantly better                         |
| Satisfaction        | Similar / Slightly better                    |
| Marks (Performance) | Numerically better but not significant       |
| Effect Size         | To be checked (may show small-moderate gain) |
| Visual Distribution | Possibly shifted upward                      |


A small effect size (Cohen‚Äôs d = -0.25) indicated a very slight, non-significant trend favoring traditional textbook users; however, the magnitude of this difference was negligible.

Combined with prior findings of significantly greater accessibility and comparable satisfaction, these results suggest that online textbooks offer an equally effective academic experience while providing additional usability advantages.

This is exactly how most researchers would frame it:

No harm in switching to online

Plus added benefits in accessibility & flexibility
